The strength of parametric modelling lies in the greater flexibility it offers when it comes to editing the list and manipulating the items in the list, such as joining lists, flattening lists in depth or making use of list indexing in conditional statements like For, hence allowing more efficient modelling.\n\nIndexing\nAn index refers to a position within an ordered list. Each item in a list is given an index from zero (at the beginning) to the length minus one (at the end). Square brackets are used to denote lists as well as the index of a list.\nFor instance, in list=[1,5,3], list[0] = 1 because 1 is the 1st item in the list; list[2]=3 as 3 is the last item in the list.\n\n\n\nList\nIndex\n\n\n\n\nList = [[0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8]]\nList[1] = [3,4,5]\n\n\na = entity1b = entity2List = [a, b]\nList[0] = a = entity1\n\n\n\n\nList Depth\nThe depth of a list is determined by the number of times by a sublist is nested inside of it.\nA list with the depth of 1 is also known as a flat list, as it has no sublist nested in it.\n\n\n\nList\nDepth of list\n\n\n\n\na = [0,1,2]\n1\n\n\nb = [1,2,3,[2,1]]\n2\n\n\nd = [1,2,3,[3,[2,1]],4]\n3\n\n\n\n\nOrder in a List\nWhen using query.Get or any other functions with entity-sorting options, the list returned can be acquired in an ascending order, descending order or geometric order.\n\n\n\nOrder\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAscending\nData is in ascending order e.g “ps0”, “ps1”, “ps2”\n\n\nDescending\nData is in descending order e.g “ps2”, “ps1”, “ps0”\n\n\nGeometric\nThe sequence of obtaining the geometric data follows that of the entity e.g “ps1”, “ps2”, “ps3”. The sequence may or may not follow an ascending order, depending how the entity is constructed.\n\n\n\n\nWhen generating entities from a list of positions using functions like make.Loft and make.Polygon, the order of entities in the list is crucial in creating logical models. In fact, strange looking geometries may be generated when the list is not in geometric order. Therefore, when encountering such problems, users are advised to check through the order of entities.\n\n\nSee Common Bugs and Misconceptions: Order of Items in Lists\n\n\nList Manipulations\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Manipulation\n    Code\n    Note\n    Example\n    \n    \n    Slice\n    sublist=[starting index: ending index]\n    The sublist returned will begin with the item with starting index and stop right before the item with ending index. \n         \n       \n      Create a sublist from list[2] to list[4].\n    \n    \n    sublist=starting index:]\n    When the ending index is left blank, the Console will return a sublist that stops at the very last item of the parent list.\n         \n       \n     Create a sublist from list[1] to the last item in list.\n    \n    \n    sublist=[:ending index]\n    When the starting index is left blank, the Console will return a sublist that begin with the very first item of the parent list.\n         \n       \n      Create a sublist from the first item in list to the list[1].\n    \n    \n    Copy\n    sublist=[:]\n    When both the starting index and the ending index are left blank, the Console will return the full parent list.\n         \n       \n     Create a sublist with all items from the parent list.\n    \n    \n    Mathematical Operation\n    NA\n    Lists are not numerals, they cannot be operated on mathematically.\n         \n       \n     Strings are returned when 2 lists are added\n    \n\n\n\n"},"contents/chapter_3_procedures/Expression.html":{"url":"contents/chapter_3_procedures/Expression.html","title":"Expression","keywords":"","body":"Expression \nAn expression is a combination of values, variables and/or operators.

There are two types of loops in Mobius, For and While. As variables defined in a loop cannot be directly referenced outside of a loop, we will have to create lists to extract values out of the loops.\nLoops are key procedures that bring out the importance of computational thinking in efficient 3D modelling. The efficiency is further improved in cases where multiple loops are nested within one another. \nWhile loops may seem rather challenging to apply at first, users are encouraged to constantly experiment with them, for the mastery in utilising the loops will prove to be extremely beneficial. After having a good grasp of the loops, users can create complex models using loops as shortcuts. This will quicken model making processes, especially when contrasted against direct modelling methods.\n\nSee Extract data out of a Loop Using Lists\n\n\nFor\nThe For statement runs every element in a finite list through the same sequence of codes. As such, it is also known as a For loop. In other words, it can be understood as for each. \n\nApplication of For\nThe For function can operate on elements in any lists, be it a list of numbers or a list of entities.\n\nExample 1. For item in a list of entities\nEach pgon in a list of pgons are cut with a copied and scaled down version of itself. \n     \n       \n     \n\nExample 2. For item in a list of numbers\nThe list of number, range(0, 10) is used to generate 10 copies of pgon that are equally spaced out, as each of them is moved a distance ranging from 0 unit to 45 units from pgon.\n     \n       \n     \n\nWhile\nThe While statement iterates a sequence of codes as long as the specified conditions remains true. It is also known as a While loop.\n\nApplication of While\nAs long as the total number is less than 100, the number of apples will increase by 4 each round. The process stops right before the total number of apples exceed 100.\n     \n       \n     Figure: Example of a While statement\n\nLoops Within a Loop\nLoop(s) can be created within a loop. There is no limit to the number of loops that can be used within one. \n\nExample\nTo understand a block of For loop like this, learners are encouraged to take time to use the terminate function and print the returns from each statement to understand how the Procedure Lines work with one another in the Procedure Space.\n     \n       \n     Figure: a For Loop within a For Loop\n"},"contents/chapter_3_procedures/Break.html":{"url":"contents/chapter_3_procedures/Break.html","title":"Break","keywords":"","body":"Break\nThe Break statement is used within a For or While to break the loop and terminate it by skipping the remaining codes within the loop and continuing the execution of code outside the loop. \nThis statement is used with an If statement within the loop to specify the test condition, where the break is performed if the condition is met.\n\nExample\nThere are 19 rounds of apple-giving, 4 apples are given per round while the basket can only hold a maximum of 50 apples.
