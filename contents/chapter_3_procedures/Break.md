### Break

The Break statement is used within a [For](Loops.md) or [While](Loops.md) to break the loop and terminate it by skipping the remaining codes within the loop and continuing the [execution](/chapter_1_mobius_interface/execute.md) of code outside the loop. 

This statement is used with an [If](If_Elseif_and_Else.md) statement within the loop to specify the test condition, where the break is performed if the condition is met.
