### Functions {#functions}

A function performs operations on the inputs in the [argument boxes](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/procedure_line.md) and [returns](/chapter_1_mobius_interface/execute.md) outputs that can be [printed](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/procedure_line.md) in the [Console](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/console.md) and/or modifies the model in the [3D Viewer](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/3D_view.md).

Below is a table of function categories that are available in Mobius. Individual functions in each category can be understood by using the [Help](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/help_viewer.md) and [Tooltip](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/procedure_menu.md) features.
