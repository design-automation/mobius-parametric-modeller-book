# Chapter 3: Procedures {#chapter-3-procedures}

In programming, a procedure is a set of [statements](Statements.md) that tells a computer how to run a program. There are [rules](Rules.md) governing how the statements work with one another in a procedure.

In Mobius, procedures are represented in the form of [Procedure Lines](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/procedure_line.md) in the [Procedure Space](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/procedure_space.md). All the procedure writing take place in the [Left Viewport](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/left_viewport.md).
