## Statements {#statements}

A statement is a line of code that may be [executed](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/execute.md). It is the building block that makes up the computational work that is going on in a [node](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/nodes.md). 

The statements in Mobius can be found in the [Procedure Menu](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/procedure_menu.md). They are added into the [Procedure Space](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/procedure_space.md) as [Procedure Lines](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/procedure_line.md). The statements in Procedure Menu are arranged into 3 categories: [Basic](Basic.md), [Functions](Functions.md) and [Inline](Inline.md).
