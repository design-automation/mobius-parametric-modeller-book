### Continue

The Continue statement is used within a [For](Loops.md) or [While](Loops.md) loop to skip the remaining code within the current iteration of the loop and continuing the [execution](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/execute.md) of code in the next iteration of the loop. Unlike [Break](Break.md), Continue does not terminate the loop but only skips that particular iteration.

This statement is used with an [If](If_Elseif_and_Else.md) statement within the loop to specify the condition, where the continuation is performed if the condition is met.

###### Example
In 9 rounds of sum adding, in each round 10 is added to a number from the range of 1 to 9; when the sum is bigger or equal to 15, another 10 is added to sum to obtain a new sum.
