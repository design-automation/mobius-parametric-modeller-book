# Topology

![Overview](./imgs/topology.PNG)

Topology is automatically generated from existing user-defined objects. Attributes may be attached to topological components, which may be viewed in the Attribute Table. 

__**Vertex**__

A _vertex_ is a location in space, and can be connected to zero, one, or two edges. 

__**Edge**__

An _edge_ is a line segment joining two vertices in a polyline or polygon.

__**Wire**__

A _wire_ is a multi-segmented line defining a polyline or bounding the surface of a polygon. 

__**Face**__

A _face_ is a surface bounded by a wire(s).

## Hierarchy

All objects can be broken down into their topological components, which are connected in a hierarchy. The figures below show two examples of the topological hierarchy, for a polyline and a polygon. The polygon also includes a hole.

## Objects sharing positions

When multiple objects share the same positions, modifying one object could mean modifying the positions for it, which could affect all other objects that share those positions.

When an object needs to be moved without affecting other objects, it needs to be unwelded. Unwelding creates a duplicate of the shared positions (by creating new positions at that same location). As a result, the positions for the different objects will be different, even though they are at the same location. 

The following diagrams show the differences between welded and unwelded polylines and polygons:
