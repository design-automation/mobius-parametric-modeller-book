# Attributes

Attributes define the types of data that can be attached to entities. The attribute values may be viewed in the Attribute Table. 

## Default Attributes

There are default attributes that are generated when certain objects are created. Specifically, when positions are created, the coordinates of each position are automatically displayed as attributes in the Attribute Table. 

One default attribute is the XYZ coordinates of positions. In this case, the attribute is associated with positions entities, the name is `xyz`, the data type is `number` and the data size is `3`. Each position then has different XYZ values for this attribute. 

All entities also have a default `id` attribute that specifies a unique ID for the entity. The IDs consists of a two letters followed by a number. The letters define the entity type, as follows:
  * ps: positions
  * _v: vertices
  * _e: edges
  * _w: wires
  * _f: faces
  * pt: points
  * pl: polylines
  * pg: polygons
  * co: collections

## User-defined Attributes


In order to obtain the id of the entities, so as to assign attributes to them, use the `query.Get` function.


To _create_ an attribute, create a new variable (*Basic > Variable*). 

* In the left-hand side argument of the variable, enter `id@attributename` or `variable@attributename` to create an attribute named `attributename` for a particular id or variable (of geometries or mathematical structures) respectively. 

* In the right-hand side argument of the variable, enter the value of the attribute. The value may be a number, a string, or a flat list. 

  * *Example 1:* `"ps1"@selected = "yes"` *creates a new attribute named "selected" for the id of ps1, and gives the position "ps1" the value of "yes". The id here refers to the id given to the geometry, and can be found in the first column of the attribute table. IDs must be placed between double quotation marks to differentiate them from being read as variables.*

  * *Example 2:* `point_a@rgb = [255,0,0]` *creates three attributes named "rgb[0]", "rgb[1]", and "rgb[2]", and sets their values at 255, 0, 0 respectively for the geometry given by a previously-defined variable named "point_a".*

To _set_ an attribute, perform the same steps as if to create an attribute, but ensure that `attributename` is the name of the existing attribute whose value you wish to alter. Simply put, if the attribute has not been previously created, a new attribute is created; otherwise, it changes the value of that attribute.

![Example 3](./imgs/2.3-example3.png)

* *Example 3:* `point_a@rgb = [10,20,30]` *changes the existing values of 255, 0, 0 to 10, 20, 30 respectively for "rgb[0]", "rgb[1]", and "rgb[2]" of point_a.*

To _get_ the value of an attribute, use `id@attributename` or `variable@attributename` inline to reference their values.

![Example 4](./imgs/2.3-example4.png)

* *Example 4:* `my_number = point_a@rgb[1]` *gives my_number the value of 20, since point_a has the value of 20 set for the attribute of rgb[1].*

![Deleting](./imgs/2.3-delete.png)

To _delete_ an attribute, set the attribute with the value of `null` (without quotes).

## Adding attributes to multiple items

Creating or adding an attribute to a list does so for all items in the list.

![Example 4](./imgs/2.3-example5.png)

* *Example 5:* `my_list@yes_or_no = "yes"` *sets "yes" for the attribute named "yes_or_no" for ps1, ps2, and ps3.*
