# Chapter 2: Geo-Info Data Model

The Geo-Info (GI) data model is a 3D Geospatial Information model that stores geometry, topology, and attributes. The data model has been specifically developed for the MÃ¶bius Modeller, in order to allow complex semantically enriched geospatial parametric models to be created.

__Overview__

The GI model allows different types of entities to be defined. These entities are defined using a data structure consisting of three main layers: _positions_, _objects_, and _collections_. The Figure below shows a conceptual diagram of this hierarchy.

__Geometry__

The GI data model allows users to directly create three types of geometry: positions, objects, and collections. (Topology, described below, will be generated indirectly.) These three types of geometry define the three layers of the data structure. 

The bottom layer of the GI data model is the positions layer. Positions are locations in 3D space, specified by three coordinates, `[x,y,z]`. Such positions are starting point for all other types of geometric entities. 

The middle layer of the GI data model consists of objects. There are three  types of objects: _points_, _polylines_, and _polygons_. Points are simple points in space. Polyline consist of a sequence of straight line segments. Polylines can be closed or open, and can be planar or non-planar. Polygons are surfaces define by an exterior boundary consisting of a sequence of straight line segments. The polygon may also have hole, in which case it will include additional interior boundaries, also sequences of straight line segments. Polygons may be planar or non-planar. 

The top layer of the GI data model consists of collections. Collections group together objects that are semantically related in some way.

__Topology__

Objects are define using a hierarchy topological components, consist of four levels: _vertices_, _edges_, _wires_, and _faces_. A vertex is a location in space, linked to exactly one position. An edge connects two vertices with a straight line segment. A wire consists of a sequence of edges, connected through shared vertices. If a wire may be open or closed. Finally, a face defines a surface bounded by a closed wire. A face may also have additional wires defining the holes in the face. A point has exactly one vertex. A polyline has exactly one wire, which can have multiple edges and vertices. A polygon has exactly one face, which will have one or more wires, each of which can be further decomposed into multiple edges and vertices.

The key concept in the GI data model is that the topological components inside objects are never shared. Thus, one object cannot share vertices or edges with another object. Instead, each object has its own distinct set of topological components. However, this is not the case for positions and collections. 
  * First, objects can have vertices that link to the same positions. This allows objects to be connected together. We refer to this as the the vertices being '_welded_'. When the positions are modified (i.e. moved), both objects will be updated.
  * Second, objects can belong to multiple collections. Thus, a polygon that represents a wall can belong to two 'room' collections, representing the two rooms on either side of the wall.

__Attributes__

All entities (positions, objects, topological components, and collections) in a GI data model can have data attached to them, in the form of attributes. This is a powerful feature that allows models to become semantically enriched with all sorts of data. 

An attribute is associated with a specific entity type and has a name, a data type, and a data size. The possible data types are `string` or `number`. The data size can be 1 or more. If the data size is greater than 1, then the attribute will be assumed to be a list. Each entity can then have different values for that specified attribute.

_(For more information on attributes, see section 2.3.)_

 __Terminology__

 The terminology for a GI model is as follows:
  * _Entity_: Refers to any type of entity in the model, including positions, objects, topologies, and collections.
  * _Geometry_: Refers to all entities except topologies, including positions, objects, and collections.
  * _Collection_: A collection of objects. Object may appear in more than one collection. 
  * _Object_: A point, a polyline, or a polygon.
  * _Topology_: A vertex, an edge, a wire, or a face. Also referred to as 'topological components'. 
  * _Position_: A position, that can be linked to vertices. Each position can be linked to multiple vertices.
