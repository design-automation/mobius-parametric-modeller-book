### Zoom [extent/selected] {#zoom-extent-select} 

The zoom extent/selected button allows users to centre their models in the [3D Viewer](3D_view.md).

In the case when users have multiple massings within the viewer, selecting a polygon before clicking on this button will allow the 3D Viewer to zoom into the selection and Mobius will automatically set this [polygon](..\chapter_2_geo-info_data_model\Polygon.md) as the centre of rotation in the 3D Viewer.
