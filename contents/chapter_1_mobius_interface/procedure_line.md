### Procedure Line {#procedure-line}

A Procedure Line is a line of code embedded within the [Procedure Space](procedure_space.md) added from the [Procedure Menu](procedure_menu.md). It can be operated on by a set of keyboard shortcuts.<br>

Most Procedure Lines contain a variable declaration box, one or more input boxes (also known as argument boxes if the procedure is a [function](..\chapter_3_procedures\Functions.md), and 4 buttons, namely Help, Print, Show Geometric Entities and Disable Procedure.

#### Help 

Clicking the help button will switch the [Right Viewport](right_viewport.md) to the [Help Viewer](help_viewer.md).

#### Print

Printing a line of code allows the [returns](execute.md) of the code to be shown in the [Console](console.md). <br>

To print a line of code, press the print button on the right hand side of each code such that the line is highlighted in green.

To see the returns on the console, press the [execute](execute.md) button to print the line of code before clicking on the Console button to switch the Right Interface to the console.

#### Show Geometric Entities

After highlighting the icon on the Procedure Line, upon [Execution](execute.md), it helps users to identify the [returns](execute.md) of the [function](..\chapter_3_procedures\Functions.md) in the [3D Viewer](3D_view.md).

#### Disable Procedure

![Disable icon](..\assets\chapter_1_assets\Disable.png)

![Procedure Line appears faded after disabling](..\assets\chapter_1_assets\Disable2.png)

Upon [Execution](execute.md), it disables the Procedure Line. This feature is useful for [debugging](..\chapter_4_bugs_and_debugging\Debugging_Workflow.md).
