### Node Menu {#node-menu}

The Node Menu displays a list of [nodes](nodes.md) that have been created in the [flowchart](flowchart.md). Clicking on one switches the [Left Viewport](left_viewport.md) to the [Procedure Tab](procedure.md) of the selected node. This menu makes it convenient for users to switch between nodes without having to return to the Flowchart tab.
