# Chapter 6: Examples

This chapter contains some examples of models created in MÃ¶bius Modeller and discusses the thought process behind them. 

The explanations given here will be relating to the model and why certain values are used. However, this section will not discuss how each function works or what to input into each argument; for more information on those, please see Appendix, or mouse over the function in the sidebar or click on the help icon (?) beside the function.
