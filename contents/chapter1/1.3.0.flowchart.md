# Flowchart

In parametric design, _propagation-based systems_ (Aish and Woodbury, 2005) are commonly used, usually visualised through graphs. Graphs contain nodes connected by links—which may be given a direction and visualised by an arrow—to form a flowchart. Such a system orders the information that is known at the beginning of the flowchart, and proceeds along the links to compute the unknowns or to solve a given constraint.

## Nodes

_Nodes_ are containers of code that carry procedures on how to process the information passing through it. 

The number of nodes in each flowchart varies depending on the complexity of the modelling task. In general, the parametric design process is broken down into stages, with each stage being contained within a node.

While in the 'Flowchart' tab, 
* To _create_ a new node, double-click anywhere in the canvas. 
* To _rename_ a node, click on a node once to select it; click on it again to edit the name; click outside the node to commit the changes.
* To _edit_ the contents of a node, double-click on the node, which switches automatically to the 'Procedure' tab to allow modification to the code.
* To _reorganise_ the placement of nodes in the flowchart for better visualisation, click and hold while dragging to arrange. Zoom in or out on the flowchart by scrolling with the mouse wheel; zoom extents by clicking on the icon at the top right of the flowchart.
* To _delete_ a node, click on a node once to select it, then hit 'del' to delete it.

## Links

_Links_ are connections between nodes, and in a propagation-based system, they are represented by arrows in the flowchart. For information to pass from one node to another, they have to be connected by a link in the corresponding direction. 

While in the 'Flowchart' tab,
* To _connect_ one node to another, click anywhere in the grey highlight of the first node and drag to the receiving node before releasing. As you drag, you should see a faint dash line to show where the link will be; before releasing, the highlight around the receiving node should appear as you mouse over the node. The arrow signifies the direction that information is being passed.
* To _disconnect_ nodes, click on the link once to select it, then hit 'del' to delete it. A disconnected node is greyed out and the procedures within it will not be executed.

## Create New/Save/Load Flowchart

To _create_, _save_ or _load_ a flowchart, click on the name of the flowchart to display a dropdown enumeration, then select the corresponding option.

## Execution

Execution of the flowchart results in a 3D model being pushed through the flowchart, starting at the _Start_ node, and ending at  the _End_ node. Along the way, each node executes the procedure that it contains. Through this processes, the 3D model is gradually modified and updated.
