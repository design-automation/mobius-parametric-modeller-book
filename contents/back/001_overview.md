# Chapter 4: Modelling Functions

The functions in MÃ¶bius Modeller are used within nodes and may be categorised into the following:

## Query

_Query_ functions set, retrieve or modify attributes attached to objects.

* Get
* Invert
* Count
* Neighbours
* Sort

## Make

_Make_ functions create new geometry. 

* Position
* Point
* Polyline
* Polygon
* Collection
* Copy
* Hole
* Loft

* Divide
* Unweld

## Modify

_Modify_ functions alter the original geometry. 

* Move
* Rotate
* Scale
* Mirror
* XForm
* Collection
* Reverse
* Shift
* Close
* PushAttribs

## Intersect (isect)

_Intersect_ functions primarily involves the division of an object or list by intersecting.

## Calculate (calc)

_Calculate_ functions evaluate the properties of geometry.

* Distance
* Length
* MinDistance
* Area
* Normal
* Centroid
* ParamTToXyz
