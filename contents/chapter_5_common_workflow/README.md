A few common workflows are provided in this chapter to help users to consolidate what they have learnt and kickstart their modelling process.

Workflow examples in this chapter include:
- [Creating a simple volume in a single node](Creating_a_Simple_Single_Volume.md)
- [Creating a complex volume in a single node](Creating_a_Complex_Single_Volume_Using_Foreach_Loop.md)
- [Creating a volume with nodes in series](Creating_a_Volume_With_Nodes_in_Series.md) 
- [Creating a volume with nodes in parallel](Creating_a_Volume_With_Nodes_in_Parallel.md)
- [Creating a volume with parameters](Creating_a_Volume_With_Parameters_and_Variables.md)
- [Extracting Data out of a Loop Using List](Extract_Data_Out_of_a_Loop_Using_Lists.md)
