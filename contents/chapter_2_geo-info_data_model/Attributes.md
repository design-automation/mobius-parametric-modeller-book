## Attributes {#attributes}

Attributes define the types of data that can be attached to [entities](Entities.md). An attribute contains an attribute name and an attribute value pair, both of which may be viewed in the [Attribute Table](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/3D_view.md) under the [Entity Type Tabs](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/3D_view.md) the attribute is associated with, unless the attribute is a reserved attribute. 

There are three types of attributes: [default attributes](Default_Attributes.md), [user-defined attributes](User_Defined_Attributes.md) and [reserved attributes](Reserved_Attributes.md). The prior two are created by either the system or the users to allow for easier access to certain existing entity and values, by [referencing](..\chapter_3_procedures\Rules.md) using the [query.Get](..\chapter_3_procedures\QueryGet.md) function. The last one is used to perform certain program functions and thus cannot be referenced.
