## Entities {#entities}

Entities include [positions](Position.md), [topology](Topology.md), [objects](Objects.md) and [collections](Collection.md). For instance, an entity can be either a polygon or a collection of polygons. All entities created can be visualised in the [3D Viewer](..\chapter_1_mobius_interface\3D_view.md). Information about them can be found in the [Attribute Table](..\chapter_1_mobius_interface\3D_view.md).
