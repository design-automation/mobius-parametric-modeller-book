### Topology {#topology}

When creating geometries, i.e. positions and objects, topological components and [attributes](Attributes.md) will be automatically generated. Topology consists entity information carried by the model that is generally not used in the coding and modelling process.

#### Table of Topological Components
| Topology | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Vertices | A vertice is a location in space, linked to exactly one position. |
| Edges | An edge connects two vertices with a straight line. |
| Wires | A wire is made up by a sequence of edges, connected through shared vertices. |
| Faces | A face is a surface bounded by a closed wire. |
