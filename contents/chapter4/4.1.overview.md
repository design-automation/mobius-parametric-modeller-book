# Chapter 4: Query

This chapter discusses what querying is and how to perform queries. 

Querying works similar to a search engine or filter, where you specify what you are searching for, and it returns the entities as a list or the count of entities based on your conditions.

Performing a query does the search on the model up to that point, and not just the current node. This is useful to define variables to refer to geometry created in previous nodes. 

Querying primarily works based on attributes. The conditions used to define the filter applied on the results are based on attributes and their values.
