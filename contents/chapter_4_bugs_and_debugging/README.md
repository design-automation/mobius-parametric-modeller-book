# Chapter 4: Bugs and Debugging {#chapter-4-debugging}

A bug is an error in the [procedures](../chapter_1_mobius_interface/procedure.md) that causes the flowchart to be unable to be [executed](/chapter_1_mobius_interface/execute.md) or produce an unintended result. To correct the error, users will have to debug, which is the [routine process of locating and removing bugs](Debugging_Workflow.md). 

To produce desired results, users may have to debug multiple times during the coding process using hints given by the Mobius, in the form of red highlights and [error messages](Error_Messages.md), and/or by figuring out his/her [misconceptions and workflows mistakes](Common_Misconceptions_and_Workflow_Mistakes.md).
