| Explanations | The error occurs because `ex[120]` does not always refer to the top polygon in the model as this is a parametric model in which the number of polygons changes. Hence the extrusion is not created at desired polygon. | The top polygon that is meant to be extruded is always the last item in the [list](../chapter_3_procedures/List.md) of extruded polygons. The [index](../chapter_3_procedures/List.md) of the last item in `ex` is `ex[listLen(ex)-1]`. |
