# List

Square brackets are used to denote lists, as well as to refer to the index of a list. 

Numbering in MÃ¶bius Modeller follows programming, where the index starts from 0 instead of one. Thus,  the index of the list is 0, 1, 2, ..., instead of 1, 2, 3, ... and so on.

* You can create an empty list by giving a variable the value `[]` (as in `empty_list=[]`)

* You can create a list with values: `my_list = [0,"one",2,"three"]`
  * my_list[0] = 0
  * my_list[1] = "one"
  * my_list[2] = 2
  * my_list[3] = "three

* Sometimes you may encounter list of lists: `my_list = [[0,1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8]]`
  * my_list[0] = [0,1,2]
  * my_list[1] = [3,4,5]
  * my_list[2] = [6,7,8]
  * my_list[0][0] = 0
  * my_list[0][1] = 1
  * my_list[0][2] = 2
  * my_list[1][0] = 3
  * my_list[1][1] = 4
  * my_list[1][2] = 5
  * my_list[2][0] = 6
  * my_list[2][1] = 7
  * my_list[2][2] = 8

* Length function calculates and returns the length of a list, as in *length (my_list)*:
  * Example: If *my_list = [ps1, ps2, ps3]*, *length(my_list)* gives 3

* Range function uses two values, as in *range (a, b)*:
  * where *a* is the first number __(inclusive)__ in the range, and *b* is the last number __(non-inclusive)__
  * Example: *range(2,7)* would give [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  * Example: *range(0,length(my_list))* would give [0, 1, 2]
