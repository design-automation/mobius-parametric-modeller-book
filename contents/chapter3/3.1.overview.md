# Chapter 3: Öbi Language

This chapter discusses the Öbi visual programming language. 

Each Öbi program is defined by a flowchart and a set of procedures. The flowchart is defined using a graph-based approach, in which you draw nodes connected with links. The is defined as Directed Acyclic Graph (i.e. no loops and feedback links). The procedures are defined using a blocks-based visual programming approach, and may contain control flow constructs such as loops and conditionals.
