# Syntax

MÃ¶bius Modeller uses the following syntax rules for its arguments:

## Functions

Functions have input arguments and return either geometry or a value. The input arguments are the boxes on the right-hand side after the function name. 

## Inline functions 

Inline functions may be written in any argument box by specifying the function followed by round brackets. 

* Example
  * `range (0, 5)` would give a list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

## Quotation marks

Quotation marks are used to denote that what is contained within them is a string. Single quotation marks and double quotation marks are accepted; however, do not mix them.

Accepted: `"hello"`, `'hello'`
Not accepted: `"hello'`

## Parenthesis

Square brackets `[` and `]` are used to denote lists and indexing of lists.

Round brackets `(` and `)` are used for inline functions and for mathematical and logical operations.

## Logical operators 

* **&&** AND

* **||** OR

* **!** NOT

* Example:
  * `a == 5 && b != 10` would mean *a* equals to 5 AND *b* not equals to 10
  * `a == 5 && b != 10 || c == 15` would mean (*a* equals to 5 AND *b* not equals to 10) OR *c* equals to 15

### Precedence of logical operators

You can use round brackets to group operands with their logical operators, as you do in mathematics. However, in the absence of parenthesis, 

* ! takes higher precedence over &&
* && takes higher precdence over ||

So `a == 5 && b != 10 || c == 15` would be taken to be the same as `(a == 5 && b != 10) || (c == 15)`. 

## Comparison operators

* **==** equal (in value)
* **===** equal (in value AND type)
* **<** less than
* **<=** less than or equal to
* **>** more than
* **>=** more than or equal to
* **!=** not equal to

## Mathematical operators

* __+__ add 
* __-__ subtract
* __*__ multiply
* __/__ divide
* __%__ modulo (remainder after division)
