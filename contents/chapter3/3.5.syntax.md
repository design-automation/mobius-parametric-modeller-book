# Syntax

Möbius Modeller uses the following syntax rules for its arguments:

## Quotation marks

Quotation marks are used to denote that what is contained within them is a string. Single quotation marks and double quotation marks are accepted; however, do not mix them.

Accepted: `"hello"`, `'hello'`
Not accepted: `"hello'`

## Parenthesis

Square brackets `[` and `]` are used to denote lists and indexing of lists.

Round brackets `(` and `)` are used for inline functions and for mathematical and logical operations.

## Logical operators 

* **&&** AND

* **||** OR

* **!** NOT

* Example:
  * `a == 5 && b != 10` would mean *a* equals to 5 AND *b* not equals to 10
  * `a == 5 && b != 10 || c == 15` would mean (*a* equals to 5 AND *b* not equals to 10) OR *c* equals to 15

### Precedence of logical operators

You can use round brackets to group operands with their logical operators, as you do in mathematics. However, in the absence of parenthesis, 

* ! takes higher precedence over &&
* && takes higher precdence over ||

So `a == 5 && b != 10 || c == 15` would be taken to be the same as `(a == 5 && b != 10) || (c == 15)`. 

## Comparison operators

* **==** equal (in value)
* **===** equal (in value AND type)
* **<** less than
* **<=** less than or equal to
* **>** more than
* **>=** more than or equal to
* **!=** not equal to

## Mathematical operators

* __+__ add 
* __-__ subtract
* __*__ multiply
* __/__ divide
